# Book Management Application

This project is a Bookstore Management Application developed as part of my journey in learning the MERN stack, specifically focusing on Node.js and MongoDB. The application utilizes EJS for templating and Tailwind CSS for styling. It's perfect for someone who is looking for a beginner-friendly MERN project, one can refer to this as a starting point.
